          Over two years into the project gave me enough insight to take over a
          leadership role in my team. I would still design most of our
          prototypes but leave the development to my team and take on the
          responsibility for delivering whole functionalities. My focus was set
          on managing and meeting attainable business expectations while keeping
          high coding standards.

          developed at the same time. As my experience and business knowledge
          grew, I transitioned to designing parts of the user interface from the
