        Front-end web development is the main direction of my career path. I
        enjoy learning and honing new skills, both technical and soft. Leading a
        team has taught me quite a lot and gave me a whole new perspective which
        doesn’t mean I would mind getting closer to the codebase. Having worked
        with AngularJS for a while, I’ve been moving towards ReactJS but I stay
        open-minded and thrive on innovation. From what I’ve noticed in
        comparison with my colleagues, I’m quite diligent and pay much attention
        to detail — I read every e-mail I get, follow each corporate procedure
        and always check my work, twice. I’ve been told that editing my code is
        a pleasure since it’s cleanly formatted and legible — I won’t deny it, I
        do take pride in my work!
